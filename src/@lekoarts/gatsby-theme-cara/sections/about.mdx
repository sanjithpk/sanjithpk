# About Me

I'm currently a student doing a degree in Computer Science and Engineering and love solving real world problems.
I have created websites either from the front-end or the back-end mostly using JavaScript, React & Redux, Node.js, Express.js & MongoDB.
If you have an exciting project in mind, or would like to simply chat, feel free to do so.
