description: How to make the most of your four years in engineering.

As I am writing this, I got my final semester results, so I have officially finished my four years of engineering. I wanted to share my experience in these four years, what I did and what I should have but did not.

### First Year

I did not do much in my first year, I was just getting used to the engineering life. I mostly went out to watch movies, played some games, traveled in and around the city but nothing related to coding except the college course.

What I should have done instead is to start getting my hands dirty with competitive coding, trying to learn about open source development, how git works, how the web works. Explore all the available domains and be part of some community and discuss these things on either week to week or monthly basis.

### Second Year

This is the year when my coding life started. I joined an open source club created by our seniors. We used to discuss many things related to what are the technologies that are booming and what are the ones which are slowly getting replaced. I learned about git, learned how the web works, and started getting into the web development route. Different people were into different things such as Rust and Machine Learning using ML. We used to share whatever we learned as well.

For the most part, this is what I should have done except that I still didn't dabble in competitive coding, problem-solving, or get invested in data structures at all. I should have definitely set aside some time every day at least for some problem-solving. Apart from this, I should have attended some talks or hackathons as well.

### Third Year

I continued with my web development journey and start learning React, built a website for my club as well. It was a really good experience. I even attended the Smart India Hackathon with my team and in the end, we won as well! I also attended some talks and events and got to build some connections. This year I even started to do some competitive coding in CodeChef, HackerEarth, and HackerRank.

All in all, this was the best year till now as I was having a great time and not wasting time. The only thing I did not do is an internship. I should have looked more into this as I could have gotten more exposure to the current industry.

### Final Year

As we had a pandemic, most of the classes were online. This year I heavily concentrated on Data structures and Algorithms with Leetcode. Since I already had some projects my resume was fine, so all I did was prepare for coding rounds and applied for off-campus companies. My final semester was spent mostly doing the internship.

I should have made more connections on Linkedin and Twitter for referrals so that my chances of getting shortlisted would have been better.

### Conclusion

Hope you got some insights from my journey these four years. Try to enjoy utilize these four years as much as you can but also make some good friends along the way and try to educate others along the way, 'cause you may never get to experience this again in your life.
