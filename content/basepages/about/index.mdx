Hello, I am Sanjith PK

I have always enjoyed playing games, constantly thinking of theories, and solving difficult challenges. One day, I decided to give programming a try and discovered that web development was my preferred career over the various others in the field.
Being a developer is much more than just writing code. Communication skills, a clear mindset, result focused systems, and the ability to set realistic steps to achieve the future result is crucial to a developer's worth.
